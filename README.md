## 🔎 What This Repository Demonstrates

- Production environment architecture overview  
- Edge configuration discipline (Cloudflare DNS / TLS)  
- Monitoring policy alignment  
- Change control structure  
- Security posture documentation (sanitized)  
- Controlled release and documentation workflows  

These artifacts reflect operational maturity — not theoretical design.

## 🔐 Security & Sanitization Policy

This repository intentionally excludes:

- Credentials or secrets  
- Internal identifiers  
- Raw logs  
- Administrative screenshots  
- Internal automation scripts  

Private repositories remain the source of truth for operational depth.

## 🎯 Intent

This repository serves as public proof of:

- Structured reliability thinking  
- Failure-mode awareness  
- Security-conscious configuration  
- Documentation discipline  
- Operational accountability  

The goal is not feature quantity — it is controlled, inspectable evolution.
